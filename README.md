# ðŸª¦ TraceMachina graveyard

As projects grow, shrink and change we sometimes remove parts of our codebases
because they don't fit in with our maintenance or security models.

This repository contains code that we removed from the mainline repos but that
could still be useful reference material at some point.

> [!WARNING]
> This repository comes without **ANY** security or maintenance guarantees. The
> code in here is unmaintained and is likely buggy, insecure, and straight up
> broken. Only use this as reference material.
